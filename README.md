# Robot Emulator
**Contact:** <revol-xut@protonmail.com>

The main objective of this project is to automatically test industry robotics related programs. For this purpose the program is run in this simulated environment and it's actions are recorded. The resulting collected data is then compared to the expected behavior and the correctness of the program is assessed. The Robot-Emulator project also provides tools which can be used to simulated real-world sensors, cameras and any other peripheral devices which supplies data.
